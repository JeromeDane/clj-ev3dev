  you try to stop the hub of the motor with your thumb,

  the motor. In some cases, this is not what you want. You
  want the motor to 'try harder' when it encounters
  resistanceand - and the regulation_mode attribute is
  going to help us with that.

  :on mode
  When the regulation_mode attribute is set to on, the motor
  driver attempts to keep the motor speed at the value you've
  specified.
  You can change the speed by calling set-speed function, e.g.
  (set-speed config motor 275)

  If you slow down the motor with a load, the motor driver tries
  to compensate by sending more power to the motor to get it to
  speed up. If you speed up the motor for some reason, the motor
  driver will try to compensate by sending less power to the motor."

           also shorts the power wires of the motor together. When a motor is manually
           rotated, it acts as an electrical generator, so shorting the power wires
           creates a load that absorbs energy.
  :hold  - actively hold the motor position when stopping. Instead of removing power
           from the motor, the motor controller will start a PID to prevent the motor
           from being turned any further. It's intended for use with run-to-*-pos
